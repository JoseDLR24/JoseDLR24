I'm Jose De Los Reyes from Colombia, I enjoy web development and creating designs for the web. I'm sure you have heard of Colombia, I mean, we have the most delicious coffee, right?
So, here you have a passionate Colombian bringing you programming and design from the other side of the world with a cup of hot coffee.

 I like to learn JavaScript and ReactJS, these are challenging subjects, but I find them fascinating and rewarding. Also, I enjoy creating wireframes and UI/UX designs.


Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / SASS / SEO
